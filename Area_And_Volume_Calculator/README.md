# 📐 Area & Volume Calculator – Python Mini Project

A **command-line Python tool** that calculates area and volume for **8 geometric shapes**:
- Square
- Rectangle
- Circle
- Triangle
- Cube
- Cuboid
- Cylinder
- Sphere

This project strengthened my **logic building, function structuring, and CLI interaction skills** while reinforcing Python fundamentals—an essential step before advancing to automation and more complex portfolio projects.

## 🚀 Why This Project?
This mini project was part of my **Python fundamentals practice** to:
✅ Build structured CLI tools  
✅ Practice geometry logic in programming  
✅ Establish consistency before moving into:
- Automation projects
- Data visualization projects
- SolidWorks/Python integrations

---

## 🪄 What's Next
I will now work on:
- A **CSV Part List Reader** automation project for mechanical workflows.
- Graph plotting for engineering data using `matplotlib`.
- Automation scripts aligned with mechanical design needs.
