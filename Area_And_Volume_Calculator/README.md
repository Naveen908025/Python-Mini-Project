# 📐 Area & Volume Calculator – Python Mini Project

A **command-line Python tool** that calculates area and volume for **8 geometric shapes**:
- Square
- Rectangle
- Circle
- Triangle
- Cube
- Cuboid
- Cylinder
- Sphere

This project strengthened my **logic building, function structuring, and CLI interaction skills** while reinforcing Python fundamentals—an essential step before advancing to automation and more complex portfolio projects.
